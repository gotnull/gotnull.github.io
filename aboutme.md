title: About Me
subtitle: Systems Engineer & Technical Writer
---

I'm Lester Knight Chaykin, a systems engineer and technical writer with a deep fascination for low-level computing, hardware design, and retro technology. This blog is my digital workshop—a space where I explore, create, and share technical knowledge.

## What I Write About

I focus on technical topics that interest me, including:

- **Emulation & Virtualization**: CPU emulators, system design, interpreter architectures
- **Embedded Systems**: ESP32, Arduino, STM32, AVR microcontrollers
- **Low-Level Programming**: C, C++, assembly, Rust for embedded systems
- **Hardware Design**: Circuit design, PCB layout, digital logic, FPGA development
- **Computer Architecture**: CPU design, memory systems, bus protocols
- **Retro Computing**: Game console internals, reverse engineering, hardware hacking
- **Signal Processing**: Communication protocols (SPI, I2C, UART, CAN)

Each post builds on previous work, exploring different angles of systems programming and hardware design. I try to maintain a consistent technical depth while keeping things accessible.

## The Blog

This site runs on Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I write regularly about projects I'm working on, concepts I'm learning, and technical deep-dives that interest me. The Pong game you might have noticed is a small embedded project I occasionally tinker with.

## Philosophy

I believe in learning through building. Most of my posts are hands-on explorations rather than pure theory. I value clear technical writing that gets to the point without unnecessary abstraction.

There are no comments on this blog—it's primarily my personal technical journal made public for anyone who might find it useful.

If the topics here resonate with you, feel free to explore the archives. I hope you find something interesting.

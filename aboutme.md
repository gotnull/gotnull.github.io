My name is Lester Knight Chaykin. I am a physicist. I arrived at my high-tech underground laboratory in my car during a thunderstorm and began working on my experiment using a particle accelerator, attempting to reconstruct what happened when the universe was born. Just before the particles reached their intended destination, a lightning bolt struck the laboratory and interfered with the accelerator, causing an unforeseen particle fusion and an explosion. This event opened a hole in time and space, teleporting me to a barren, alien planet.

After evading numerous dangerous indigenous animals, I was captured by a race of humanoid aliens and taken to a subterranean prison camp. I escaped along with an alien captive known as "Buddy," and we evaded capture while traveling through a series of hazardous environments. We battled alien soldiers and wild creatures while solving numerous puzzles to survive. We traversed the prison complex, a cave system, and a tower structure. I was severely wounded by one of the aliens, but with Buddy's help, I managed to defeat my attacker and escape. After reaching the top of the tower, I collapsed, but Buddy soon joined me. He picked me up, and we escaped on a dragon-like creature, flying off into the horizon.

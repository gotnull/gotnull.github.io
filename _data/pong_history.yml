history:
- summary: The improved code introduces a dynamic update to the game mode display
    in the HTML by setting the inner text of the `gameModeDisplay` element to reflect
    the current game mode when the game starts. No changes were made to the CSS or
    HTML structure itself.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:22:08'
- summary: 'The improved Pong game code introduces a new feature: a power-up that
    appears randomly on the canvas, which, when hit by the ball, increases the ball''s
    speed by 1.5 times. Additionally, the CSS was updated to use specific color codes
    for button backgrounds instead of CSS variables, ensuring consistent button styling
    across different themes.'
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:25:24'
- summary: The improved code introduces a new feature that sets a winning score of
    5, displays a victory message when a player reaches this score, and prevents the
    game from being paused after it ends. Additionally, the game now shows a win screen
    with the winner's name and an invitation to restart the game. No changes were
    made to the CSS or HTML.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:29:12'
- summary: The improved code introduces a power-up feature that increases the ball's
    speed upon collision, and includes a victory screen that displays when a player
    reaches the winning score. Additionally, the game now has a pause feature that
    prevents pausing after a game ends, and the code has been refactored for better
    readability and maintainability.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:33:22'
- summary: The bounce.mp3 file was moved to assets/audio/ and its path updated in
    pong.js. The game now starts automatically in AI vs AI mode on page load, and
    after a win, a 5-second countdown is displayed before the game restarts in AI
    vs AI mode.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:40:00'
- summary: The game now displays a countdown from 5 to 1 on the win screen before
    restarting in AI vs AI mode.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:45:00'
- summary: Fixed an issue where the game would speed up after each restart by ensuring
    the ball's speed is reset to its initial value in the `resetBall()` function.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:50:00'
- summary: Corrected the game speed issue by explicitly resetting ballSpeedX and ballSpeedY
    to their initial values within the startGame function, ensuring consistent game
    speed across restarts.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:55:00'
- summary: The improved code introduces new sound effects for hits and wins, adds
    a feature to change the game theme with a button, and updates the CSS to use a
    CSS variable for the theme color. This enhances user experience by providing auditory
    feedback and visual customization options.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 05:55:49'
- summary: Further refined the ball speed reset logic by ensuring `ballSpeedY` is
    also reset to `INITIAL_BALL_SPEED` in `resetBall()` and `startGame()` to prevent
    cumulative speed increases from power-ups across game restarts.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 06:00:00'
- summary: 'The improved code introduces a new feature allowing players to toggle
    sound effects on and off, with a button labeled "Sound: On/Off" added to the HTML
    controls. Additionally, the JavaScript logic now checks if sound is enabled before
    playing any audio effects.'
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 06:12:04'
- summary: Implemented a `ballSpeedMultiplier` to prevent cumulative speed increases.
    The multiplier is applied to ball speed calculations and reset to 1 at the start
    of each game, ensuring consistent speed across restarts regardless of power-up
    activations.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 06:15:00'
- summary: The improved code introduces a new power-up type, "shrinkPaddle," which
    temporarily reduces the paddle height when collected, in addition to the existing
    speed power-up. It also includes a visual indicator for different power-up types
    by changing the power-up's color based on its effect, enhancing gameplay dynamics.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 06:18:53'
- summary: The improved JavaScript code introduces a new variable `powerUpVisible`
    to manage the visibility of power-ups separately from their activity, ensuring
    power-ups disappear visually before being deactivated. Additionally, the `spawnPowerUp`
    function is updated to reflect this change, enhancing the game's visual feedback
    when power-ups are collected. The CSS and HTML remain unchanged.
  timestamp: '2025-07-11 06:30:43'
- summary: The improved code introduces a new multiplayer mode allowing two players
    to control paddles using 'W/S' keys for the left paddle and 'Up/Down' arrows for
    the right paddle. Additionally, the HTML instructions have been updated to reflect
    these new controls, while the CSS remains unchanged.

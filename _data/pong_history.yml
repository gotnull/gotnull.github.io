- summary: The improved code introduces a new feature allowing players to reset high
    scores with a "Reset High Scores" button, accompanied by the necessary function
    to clear high scores from local storage and update the display. Additionally,
    the handling of power-up effects is refined, ensuring temporary effects like speed

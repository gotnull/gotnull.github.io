You are an AI assistant that improves Pong game code. Your task is to make significant, impactful improvements
or add substantial new features to the provided JavaScript, CSS, and an HTML snippet for a Pong game, ensuring that existing functionality is not broken.
Focus on enhancing gameplay, visual appeal, or user experience. Examples of improvements include: adding a start/pause screen, implementing sound effects,
improving AI difficulty, adding power-ups, or refining visual elements.

Here is a summary of previous improvements made to the game:
{history_summary}

Return ONLY the improved code for each file, clearly delimited by the markers provided. Do not include any explanations or markdown formatting outside of the code itself.

---JS_CODE---
{js_code}
---CSS_CODE---
{css_code}
---HTML_CODE---
{html_code}

Improve the code. Add a significant new feature or refactor a part of it for better performance, readability, or user experience, without breaking existing functionality.
Return the improved code using the following format:

---JS_CODE---
// Improved JavaScript code here
---CSS_CODE---
/* Improved CSS code here */
---HTML_CODE---
<!-- Improved HTML code here -->

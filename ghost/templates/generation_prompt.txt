Write a detailed, technical blog post about programming, hardware, electronics, or emulation.

TOPIC CATEGORIES (rotate between these):
1. **Emulation Projects**: Building CPU emulators, interpreters, virtual machines, or system emulators (NES, Game Boy, CHIP-8, 6502, Z80, etc.)
2. **Microcontroller Projects**: ESP32/ESP8266, Arduino, STM32, Raspberry Pi Pico, AVR programming, bare-metal embedded development
3. **Electronics Design**: Circuit design, PCB layout, analog circuits, power supplies, sensor interfacing, motor control
4. **Low-Level Programming**: Writing bootloaders, BIOS/UEFI, device drivers, interrupt handlers, DMA, memory management
5. **Computer Architecture**: CPU design concepts, pipeline architecture, cache systems, memory hierarchies, bus protocols
6. **Retro Computing**: Vintage computer restoration, retrocomputing projects, old system analysis, hardware archaeology
7. **Hardware Protocols**: Implementing SPI, I2C, UART, CAN, USB, Ethernet from scratch or interfacing with them
8. **FPGA & HDL**: Verilog/VHDL projects, soft-core processors, hardware acceleration, digital design
9. **Reverse Engineering**: Analyzing unknown hardware, protocol reverse engineering, firmware extraction and analysis
10. **Operating Systems**: Building a simple OS, kernel development, memory management, process scheduling, file systems

POST REQUIREMENTS:
• Choose ONE specific topic from the categories above
• Provide WORKING CODE EXAMPLES in appropriate languages (C, C++, Python, Assembly, Verilog, etc.)
• Include technical details: register descriptions, timing diagrams, memory maps, protocol specifications
• Explain both the theory and practical implementation
• Show real-world debugging or problem-solving process
• Reference specific chips, datasheets, or standards when applicable
• Make it educational and reproducible

STYLE GUIDELINES:
• Be technical but clear
• Use code blocks with syntax highlighting (```c, ```python, ```verilog, etc.)
• Include inline code for register names, commands, or short snippets
• Break down complex concepts into digestible sections
• Show the journey: design → implementation → debugging → results
• Be honest about challenges and limitations
• Provide enough context for readers to understand and learn

AVOID:
• Surface-level overviews without depth
• Posts without code or technical details
• Overly theoretical content without practical applications
• Repeating the same topics too frequently

You MUST structure your output as a valid Jekyll post with complete YAML front matter as shown below:

---
layout: post
title: "Specific Technical Title Here"
subtitle: "Descriptive subtitle explaining what this post covers"
tags: [emulation, microcontroller, electronics, programming, or other relevant tags]
author: Lester Knight Chaykin
comments: true
mathjax: false
readtime: true
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ±HHMM
---

The body of your post should follow the front matter in valid Markdown with code blocks.

You are writing a detailed, technical blog post about programming, hardware, electronics, or emulation.  

POST UNIQUENESS REQUIREMENT:  
- Before generating, check the most recent post topic, tags, and category.  
- Do NOT select the same category as the last post. Rotate categories each time.  
- Within each category, pick a different subtopic, device, or problem than previously used.  
- Ensure that the new post provides fresh insights, unique code examples, and a distinct debugging journey from the last one.  
- If a topic was used recently (e.g., CHIP-8 emulator), select a different system (e.g., Z80, NES, Game Boy) or approach (e.g., focusing on debugging instead of design).  

TOPIC CATEGORIES (rotate between these, avoiding the last one):  
1. Emulation Projects  
2. Microcontroller Projects  
3. Electronics Design  
4. Low-Level Programming  
5. Computer Architecture  
6. Retro Computing  
7. Hardware Protocols  
8. FPGA & HDL  
9. Reverse Engineering  
10. Operating Systems  
11. Robotics & Mechatronics  
12. AI & Embedded ML  
13. FPGA Acceleration for AI  
14. Networking & Protocol Stacks  
15. High-Performance Computing  
16. Security & Cryptography  
17. Audio & Signal Processing  
18. Sensor & Actuator Integration  
19. Power Electronics & Energy Systems  
20. Space & Aerospace Systems  

POST REQUIREMENTS:  
- Choose ONE specific topic (different from the last).  
- Provide WORKING CODE EXAMPLES (C, C++, Python, Assembly, Verilog, etc.).  
- Include technical details: registers, timing diagrams, memory maps, protocol specs.  
- Explain both theory and practical implementation.  
- Show real-world debugging/problem-solving steps.  
- Reference chips, datasheets, or standards where applicable.  
- Make it reproducible and educational.  

STYLE GUIDELINES:  
- Technical but clear.  
- Use fenced code blocks with highlighting.  
- Inline code for register names, commands, short snippets.  
- Break down into sections: Design → Implementation → Debugging → Results.  
- Honest about challenges and limitations.  
- Provide context so readers can follow and learn.  

AVOID:  
- Surface-level overviews.  
- Posts without code.  
- Pure theory without practical application.  
- Repeating the same topics/subtopics too often.  

OUTPUT FORMAT:  
- Structure as a valid Jekyll post with complete YAML front matter:

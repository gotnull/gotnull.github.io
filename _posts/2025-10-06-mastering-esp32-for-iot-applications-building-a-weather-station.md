## Introduction

The ESP32 microcontroller is renowned for its robustness and versatility, making it an excellent choice for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this blog post, we'll delve into building a comprehensive IoT-based weather station using the ESP32. We'll cover sensor integration, data acquisition, and web connectivity to transmit sensor data to a cloud server.

## Design

The IoT weather station will utilize the ESP32 to gather environmental data from multiple sensors:
- **DHT22** for temperature and humidity.
- **BMP280** for atmospheric pressure.

These sensors are chosen for their accuracy, ease of interfacing, and availability. The ESP32 will also connect to a WiFi network to send this data to a cloud platform (e.g., ThingSpeak) for storage and analysis.

### Hardware Setup

1. **ESP32 Dev Board**
2. **DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
3. **BMP280 Pressure Sensor**
4. **Breadboard and Connecting Wires**
5. **3.3V Power Supply**

### Circuit Diagram

Here's a simple wiring diagram for connecting the DHT22 and BMP280 to the ESP32:

```
[ESP32] -- [DHT22]
GPIO23 <--> Data

[ESP32] -- [BMP280]
GPIO21 <--> SDA (I2C Data)
GPIO22 <--> SCL (I2C Clock)
```

Ensure that all connections are secure and that the sensors are powered with 3.3V to match the ESP32 I/O levels.

## Implementation

We'll use the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32. First, include the necessary libraries and define the pins and WiFi credentials.

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>
#include "DHT.h"
#include "Adafruit_BMP280.h"

// WiFi credentials
const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";

// Sensor setup
#define DHTPIN 23
#define DHTTYPE DHT22
DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
Adafruit_BMP280 bmp;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  
  dht.begin();
  bmp.begin();
}

void loop() {
  float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
  float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
  float pressure = bmp.readPressure() / 100.0;

  if (isnan(humidity) || isnan(temperature)) {
    Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
    return;
  }

  Serial.print("Temperature: ");
  Serial.print(temperature);
  Serial.print(" Â°C, Humidity: ");
  Serial.print(humidity);
  Serial.print("%, Pressure: ");
  Serial.print(pressure);
  Serial.println(" hPa");

  sendToCloud(temperature, humidity, pressure);
  delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds before next read
}

void sendToCloud(float temp, float hum, float press) {
  if(WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED){
    HTTPClient http;
    String serverPath = "http://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY";
    serverPath += "&field1=" + String(temp) + "&field2=" + String(hum) + "&field3=" + String(press);

    http.begin(serverPath);
    int httpResponseCode = http.GET();
    
    if(httpResponseCode>0){
      String response = http.getString();
      Serial.println(response);
    }
    else{
      Serial.print("Error on sending POST: ");
      Serial.println(httpResponseCode);
    }
    http.end();
  }
}
```

## Debugging

During the implementation, a common issue was intermittent sensor readings, especially from the DHT22. This was resolved by ensuring a stable power supply and adding pull-up resistors to the data line.

## Results and Conclusion

The ESP32 weather station is now capable of monitoring environmental conditions and sending this data to the cloud for analysis. This project serves as a fundamental base for further expansion into automated home systems, agricultural monitoring, or any IoT application requiring robust sensor integration.

This project exemplifies how the ESP32 can be utilized in real-world IoT applications, combining sensor data acquisition, processing, and web connectivity in a seamless manner.

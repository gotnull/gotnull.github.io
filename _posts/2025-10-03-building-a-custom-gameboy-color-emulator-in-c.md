## Introduction

Emulating classic game consoles is not only a fun exercise in nostalgia but also an insightful journey into low-level programming and systems architecture. In this post, we'll construct a simple Gameboy Color emulator using C++. This project will help us understand the workings of CPU emulation, memory management, and I/O operations within the Gameboy system.

## System Overview

The Gameboy Color (GBC) is powered by an 8-bit Sharp LR35902 processor, which is similar to the Z80 but with fewer instructions and some unique hardware features. It operates at 4.19 MHz, features 32 KB of ROM, 8 KB of internal RAM, and 8 KB of video RAM. The display is a 2.6-inch diagonal TFT color screen.

## Emulator Components

Our emulator will focus on the following components:
1. **CPU**: Emulating the Sharp LR35902 instruction set.
2. **Memory**: Handling ROM, RAM, and VRAM.
3. **Graphics**: Simulating the GPU and rendering frames.
4. **Input**: Emulating button presses.
5. **Timing**: Ensuring everything runs at correct speeds.

## Setting Up the Environment

First, ensure you have a C++ development environment set up. We will use GCC for compilation. You'll also need the SDL2 library for graphics and input handling.

```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ libsdl2-dev
```

## CPU Emulation

We'll start by emulating the CPU. The CPU emulation involves decoding and executing instructions based on the binary data from the game ROM.

```c++
// Basic structure for our CPU
struct CPU {
    uint8_t registers[8]; // 8 general purpose registers
    uint16_t pc;          // Program counter
    uint16_t sp;          // Stack pointer

    // Function to execute one instruction
    void executeInstruction(uint8_t opcode) {
        switch(opcode) {
            // Add cases for each opcode
        }
    }
};
```

## Memory Management

The Gameboy memory map is crucial for the emulator. Here's how you can set it up:

```c++
struct Memory {
    uint8_t rom[0x8000];    // 32KB of ROM
    uint8_t ram[0x2000];    // 8KB of Internal RAM
    uint8_t vram[0x2000];   // 8KB of Video RAM

    uint8_t read(uint16_t address) {
        // Implement memory read logic based on address
        // Return the byte at the specified address
    }

    void write(uint16_t address, uint8_t data) {
        // Implement memory write logic based on address
    }
};
```

## Graphics and Rendering

The GBC has a simple 2D GPU that scans out graphics to the display. We will simulate this using SDL2.

```c++
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>

class Display {
public:
    SDL_Window* window;
    SDL_Renderer* renderer;

    Display() {
        SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
        window = SDL_CreateWindow("Gameboy Color Emulator", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, 160, 144, 0);
        renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED);
    }

    ~Display() {
        SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
        SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
        SDL_Quit();
    }

    void renderFrame(uint8_t* frameBuffer) {
        // Convert frame buffer to textures and render
    }
};
```

## Running the Emulator

Combining all parts, we initialize the components and enter the emulation loop.

```c++
int main() {
    CPU cpu;
    Memory mem;
    Display display;

    // Main emulation loop
    while (true) {
        // Fetch, decode, execute
        uint8_t opcode = mem.read(cpu.pc++);
        cpu.executeInstruction(opcode);

        // Handle graphics and input here
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Debugging and Challenges

Throughout the development, debugging involves a lot of logging and comparing the emulator's behavior with that of an actual GBC. Challenges might include timing issues and accurately emulating hardware quirks.

## Conclusion

Building an emulator is a complex but rewarding project that sharpens your programming and problem-solving skills while deepening your understanding of computer architecture. I encourage you to expand on this basic framework by implementing more detailed graphics emulation, sound, and more precise timing mechanisms.

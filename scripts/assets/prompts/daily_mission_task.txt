TASK BRIEF (deterministic seed: {seed} | date: {dateIso}){previousMissionDetails}
Create the Agency Atlas daily mission JSON adhering to the classic schema. Requirements:

STRUCTURE
- difficulty: estimated_playtime_minutes between 45-70. Difficulty MUST vary and can be Easy, Medium, or Hard. It should reflect the complexity of connecting clues to suspect traits, and should NOT always be 'extreme'.
- Include a top-level 'region' field: a string describing the primary geographical region of the mission.
- Provide 3-5 cities. Each city has city_name, country, order_in_chase (1-indexed), and exactly three locations with fields: name, npc_dialogue, clue_type, clue_value, point_value (integer between 45-120).
- suspect_database contains 4-6 suspects with the canonical fields (name, gender, hair_color, hobby, vehicle, favorite_food) and you may add background/motive/behavioral_pattern fields for flavor.
- suspect_traits is a map containing the definitive traits (gender, hair_color, hobby, vehicle, favorite_food) of the correct suspect.
- Include final_city, arrest_location, correct_suspect, rewards {experience_points, credits_earned, badge_name, unlocked_regions[]}.
- Include a 'solution' field: a concise string explaining how to solve the mission based on the clues.
- poster_image_url and banner_image_url may be empty strings if no artwork is needed.

DESIGN
- If previous mission details are provided, ensure the new mission is significantly different in its core elements (title, region, main suspect traits, solution approach) to avoid repetition.
- Every aspect of the generated mission (title, description, cities, suspects, traits, clues, solution, etc.) must be highly creative, distinct, and varied. Avoid generic or repetitive patterns in themes, specific locations, suspect profiles, or clue types within this single mission generation.
- The mission title must be unique and varied for each generated mission, reflecting the specific details and region of the mission, and should not repeat previous titles.
- Suspect hobbies should be specific and contextually relevant to the mission's region, theme, or narrative, rather than generic. They should offer subtle clues or red herrings that require cultural or geographical understanding.
- Ensure the mission's narrative, NPC dialogue, and clues clearly, yet subtly, guide the player to understand how suspect traits (gender, hair_color, hobby, vehicle, favorite_food) are relevant to solving the case. The connection should be discoverable through inference, not explicit statements.
- If the mission involves multiple cities, ensure the narrative focus and clue distribution are reasonably balanced across them, rather than heavily concentrating on a single city in the description or primary narrative.
- Embed 3-5 subtle contradictions, red herrings, or mirrored details. These must be internally coherent yet misleading.
- Hide decisive evidence inside linguistic nuance: metaphor, allusion, idiom, cultural reference, temporal hint, or behavioral micro-detail. No explicit "the answer is..." phrasing.
- At least three suspects must appear equally plausible when skimming. Only one suspect may satisfy all encoded clues and suspect_traits simultaneously.
- Geography, timelines, and cultural references must be accurate. Mentioned routes/travel need to make sense.
- Ensure narrative text, npc_dialogue, and clue_value content reward deep inference and cross-domain reasoning (psychology, semantics, culture, geography).
- Absolutely no trivia-style direct facts—every hint must require interpretation.

ANALYZER (INTERNAL ONLY)
- internal_analyzer must contain: reasoning_chain (list of concise steps showing why the correct suspect is unique), solvability_score (0–1), validation {format:[], facts_checked:[], errors:[]}, and difficulty_analysis with ambiguity_score, plausibility_overlap, solution_uniqueness (0–1 floats).
- Confirm determinism by referencing the seed/date inside internal_analyzer.

OUTPUT RULES
- Output strict JSON only. No markdown, comments, or explanatory prose.
- Deterministic: the same seed/date combination always yields identical output.

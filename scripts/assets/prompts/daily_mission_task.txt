TASK BRIEF (deterministic seed: {seed} | date: {dateIso})
Create the Agency Atlas daily mission JSON adhering to the classic schema. Requirements:

STRUCTURE
- difficulty is "extreme". estimated_playtime_minutes between 45-70.
- Provide 3-5 cities. Each city has city_name, country, order_in_chase (1-indexed), and exactly three locations with fields: name, npc_dialogue, clue_type, clue_value, point_value (integer between 45-120).
- suspect_database contains 4-6 suspects with the canonical fields (name, gender, hair_color, hobby, vehicle, favorite_food) and you may add background/motive/behavioral_pattern fields for flavor.
- suspect_traits is a map containing the definitive traits (gender, hair_color, hobby, vehicle, favorite_food) of the correct suspect.
- Include final_city, arrest_location, correct_suspect, rewards {experience_points, credits_earned, badge_name, unlocked_regions[]}.
- poster_image_url and banner_image_url may be empty strings if no artwork is needed.

DESIGN
- Embed 3-5 subtle contradictions, red herrings, or mirrored details. These must be internally coherent yet misleading.
- Hide decisive evidence inside linguistic nuance: metaphor, allusion, idiom, cultural reference, temporal hint, or behavioral micro-detail. No explicit "the answer is..." phrasing.
- At least three suspects must appear equally plausible when skimming. Only one suspect may satisfy all encoded clues and suspect_traits simultaneously.
- Geography, timelines, and cultural references must be accurate. Mentioned routes/travel need to make sense.
- Ensure narrative text, npc_dialogue, and clue_value content reward deep inference and cross-domain reasoning (psychology, semantics, culture, geography).
- Absolutely no trivia-style direct facts—every hint must require interpretation.

ANALYZER (INTERNAL ONLY)
- internal_analyzer must contain: reasoning_chain (list of concise steps showing why the correct suspect is unique), solvability_score (0–1), validation {format:[], facts_checked:[], errors:[]}, and difficulty_analysis with ambiguity_score, plausibility_overlap, solution_uniqueness (0–1 floats).
- Confirm determinism by referencing the seed/date inside internal_analyzer.

OUTPUT RULES
- Output strict JSON only. No markdown, comments, or explanatory prose.
- Deterministic: the same seed/date combination always yields identical output.
